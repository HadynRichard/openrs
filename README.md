# OpenRS
Thanks for checking out OpenRS. This is a project to emulate the RuneScape MMO
game server in the language C. The Python scripting language is used for game
logic and content to ease and expedite the development process.

### Platform
As of the moment, OpenRS only runs on GNU/Linux kernel version >= 2.5.66. It may
be ported some day to run on Windows and other platforms, but this is not of
high priority as GNU/Linux is the industry standard for hosting.

### Development
OpenRS is currently under development, but a stable release is on the way.
