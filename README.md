# OpenRS
Thanks for checking out OpenRS. This is a project to emulate the RuneScape MMO
game server in the language C. The Python scripting language is used for game
logic and content to ease and expedite the development process. OpenRS uses
asynchronous I/O for scalability and performance reasons. When a stable release
is made, OpenRS will be licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.
Although the project is designed such that with proper implementations any
revision can be supported, the vanilla version of OpenRS will support the
RuneScape revision #317.

### Platform
As of the moment, OpenRS only runs on GNU/Linux kernel version >= 2.5.66 (epoll
support is required). It may be ported some day to run on Windows and other
platforms, but this is not of high priority as GNU/Linux is the industry
standard for hosting.

### Development
OpenRS is currently under development, but a stable release is on the way.
